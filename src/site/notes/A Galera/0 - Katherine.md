This room stenches of cigars, alcohol and sweat. Not surprising considering who's the pig sitting in the middle of the room, hunching over his desk like the rotten leftovers had just been served.

He looks up at me, and sniffs.

"Ah, you're finally here, good. Come here, lemme see the goods." He invites me to sit in the steel chair in front of him, but I know better than to get comfortable around his type.

The heavy case goes over the table without a sound as I cringe over the smell I wish I didn't notice. I lean to the left to open the case and- What *is* that in his computer screen?

"Ohohoho! This is better than I anticipated!"

Are these... Children?

"You will get a raise for this, girl!"

He starts handling the disassembled rifle I just handed him... Probably like he was handling himself before I got here...

"Hmm, yes"

I was... Taking money from this man? Taking... Orders?

"Don't forget to thank the Kovalevs for me."

This... This scum? I intuitively reach for my holster when my eyes dart back at him. He is caressing the rifle... Didn't he notice he still has that shit on his computer screen? Is he... Is he enjoying the fact that I'm seeing this?

"What's wrong girl? I'm talking to you!"

"I am so going to regret this." My gun is out of the holster.

BANG.

He has a new hole on his head, and his chair gets pulled by the movement.

"Shit!"

I have to barricade the door. The steel chair! Shit it's not gonna be enough. My phone is ringing. It's Kons.

"Was that a fucking gunshot?!"
"I need to get out of here, now."
"And how the fuck are you going to do that?"
"The window? It's just three stories and there's some shrubs."
"What? They're gonna storm the building. Soon the cops-"
"Just pick me up when I get down ok?" I hang up. I can hear people running towards here. I need to jump. Fuck. Ok. Go!

For one fraction of a second I actually fear for my life, and then, twigs and spikes cutting me open as I hit the ground belly first. Shit this hurts. Where's Kons?

I feel disoriented, but I see headlights. It must be him. Yes! Black Chevette. I run to the door and throw myself inside as he speeds out of the parking lot.

"What the FUCK were you thinking?"
"Pedophile."
"What?"
"Chester was a pedophile. He was jerking off right before I got into his office. God knows what else he did."

Kons is quiet for a while. He's taking it in. His family has been selling guns to Chester's gang for a while now. It's probably a lot to take in.

"Shit..."
"I know."
"You do realize that killing their boss just means someone else will take their place?"
"I didn't think okay?"
"You never do."
"What else was I supposed to do?"
"Spy on him? Gather evidence?"
"And what? Call the police?"
"Shit!" Why is kons pushing the Gas? Fuck, they're behind us! "Goddamit Katherine!"
