This room stenches of cigars, alcohol and sweat. Not surprising considering who's the pig sitting in the middle of the room, hunching over his desk like the rotten leftovers had just been served.

He looks up at me, and sniffs.

"Ah, you're finally here, good. Come here, lemme see the goods." He invites me to sit in the steel chair in front of him, but I know better than to get comfortable around his type.

The heavy case goes over the table without a sound as I cringe over the smell I wish I didn't notice. I lean to the left to open the case and- What *is* that in his computer screen?

"Ohohoho! This is better than I anticipated!"

Are these... Children?

"You will get a raise for this, girl!"

He starts handling the disassembled rifle I just handed him... Probably like he was handling himself before I got here...

"Hmm, yes"

I was... Taking money from this man? Taking... Orders?

"Don't forget to thank the Kovalevs for me."

This... This scum? I intuitively reach for my holster when my eyes dart back at him. He is caressing the rifle... Didn't he notice he still has that shit on his computer screen? Is he... Is he enjoying the fact that I'm seeing this?

"What's wrong girl? I'm talking to you!"

"I am so going to regret this." My gun is out of the holster.

BANG.

He has a new hole on his head, and his chair gets pulled by the movement.

"Shit!"

I have to barricade the door. The steel chair! Shit it's not gonna be enough. My phone is ringing. It's Kons.

"Was that a fucking gunshot?!"
"I need to get out of here, now."
"And how the fuck are you going to do that?"
"The window? It's just three stories and there's some shrubs."
"What? They're gonna storm the building. Soon the cops-"
"Just pick me up when I get down ok?" I hang up. I can hear people running towards here. I need to jump. Fuck. Ok. Go!

For one fraction of a second I actually fear for my life, and then, twigs and spikes cutting me open as I hit the ground belly first. Shit this hurts. Where's Kons?

I feel disoriented, but I see headlights. It must be him. Yes! Black Chevette. I run to the door and throw myself inside as he speeds out of the parking lot.

"What the FUCK were you thinking?"
"Pedophile."
"What?"
"Chester was a pedophile. He was jerking off right before I got into his office. God knows what else he did."

Kons is quiet for a bit. His family has been selling guns to Chester's gang for a while now. It's probably a lot to take in.

"Shit..."
"I know."
"You do realize that killing their boss just means someone else will take their place, right?"
"I didn't think okay?"
"You never do."
"What else was I supposed to do?"
"Spy on him? Gather evidence?"
"And what? Call the police?"
"Shit!" Why is kons hitting the Gas? Fuck, they're behind us! "Goddamit Katherine!"

Bullets. Do I have bullets? Maybe I can hit the tires or the drivers. Look at the magazine. 10 shots, probably? I can make it work.

"Put that gun back." Kons tells me firmly. "They're not shooting at us, so we won't shoot back. I'll just try to lose them at the intersection near the mall."
"What if they do start shooting?"
"Then I doubt you will be able to do much with a pistol, but you're welcome to try."

Kons suddenly takes a quick turn. He almost hit another car. Almost. He's pretty good at what he's doing. The mall avenue gets pretty crowded this time of night on Fridays so I assume he's just gonna throw us into the traffic and hopefully lose ourselves somewhere on the other side.

We're here. The traffic light just turned red. We're gonna get hit! What? Kons is drifting around the cars? Holy shit, we're on the other side and Chester's guys can't follow us.

"We're gonna hide somewhere dark." Okay. "Don't make a noise when we do."

After driving for a couple miles, Kons finds a dark alley we can hide in. He parks the car in the alley, shuts down the engine and the lights, and waits.

"Dude, you're awesome!" I whisper, grinning at him.
"And you're crazy." He sighs "But you're probably right. My folks need to be more careful about who they make deals with."

Konstantin Kovalev. He's a pretty good guy for an arms dealer. He's a single dad and I think his daughter is adopted.  He never talks about the kid's mom anyway. He's also very religious. Right now he has his chaplet out and is murmuring some prayers in... Russian, probably.

"What now?" I ask when he stops praying.
"We need to lay low. You're coming to my place until we figure out our next step."
"Can I grab some stuff at my apartment?"
"Sure, but you need to be quick. They don't know where I live, but I'm worried about Felicia." That's his daughter's name.
"I'll be quick, don't worry."
"Okay. I think the coast is clear, let's go."

Me and Kons... I think we met around 3 years ago. I was selling snow in the old town, and he helped me hide from the cops. It was so stupid. I had a D.A.R.E. cap and T-Shirt on as a sort of "uniform" the guy I was working for made me wear. Kons just suddenly showed up from the middle of the crowd, made me remove the cap and t-shirt, gave me a blazer and started making random conversation. He had told me it was because the cops were getting close, but I didn't realize what he was doing until next morning when I saw on the news some other guy getting arrested with the same cap and t-shirt I was wearing.

I still have that blazer.

I went back to the old town every night since then hoping to meet him again, and eventually I did. We became very close friends since then. He apparently had developed a crush on me on the first few months we started hanging out, but he managed to drop it when I told him I'm a lesbian, and now we're basically brother and sister to each other.

Ok. That's my place. I just need a few things.

"Be right back."

I run up the building and thankfully my apartment is just on the second floor. Apartment 13. I rush in and start grabbing my things. Meds, drugs, personal documents, makeup, just throwing everything in a single plastic bag. I put my laptop and minor electronics inside a backpack alongside some clothes I grab without thinking. I spot the blazer Kons gave me all those years ago and immediately put it on. I lock my apartment and run back to Kons' Car before he knows it.

"Told you I'd be fast."
