I'm gonna have blood on my couch again. Should I think about what I'm gonna tell Felix? Nah. That boy is too smart for his own good. I just hope he doesn't ask too many questions. He doesn't need to know the details.

I wish I didn't know the details. Mama is gonna be so mad. What am I gonna tell her? "Hey, mama, we killed one of your best buyers. Don't worry though, he was a pedophile"... Actually that might work. But I don't think we'd be able to handle retaliation. Life would be so much easier if we had normal jobs.

Although, I don't know if Katherine could ever have a normal job. She's sitting right next to me, bleeding and moaning from the pain, but she has a giant smile on her face. Like she always has whenever I save her from dying.

"Hey, Kons, can I turn on spotify?" Frankly, it's like she just got back from a rollercoaster ride.
"Sure, just no chaotic electronica. And don't play it too loudly."
"You da boss."

Bluetooth connection sounds. A couple minutes of silence, and then...

"GIMME FUEL, GIMME FIRE, GIMME THAT WHICH I DESIRE!" Her timing is perfect. But I have to lower the volume. "You're no fun."
"You can have all the loud metal you want tomorrow. We gotta keep our heads down, remember?"

She concedes with a nod, and spends the rest of the trip headbanging quietly. She seems so perfectly chill, while I'm a mountain of nerves. I wish she was more appreciative of the things I do for her. But I guess the fact that I still give a shit about her is entirely my fault.

Also, if what she told me was true, I can't blame her. I would probably also have felt very trigger happy in that situation. Was he...? Nope. Don't want to imagine. Just, get home, make sure Felix is safe, make sure Kat is safe, and try to rest.

Deep breaths. Slow breaths. Jesus Christ is my lord and savior and no harm will come to us.

"We're here." I tell kat, redundantly. She knows the place well. She sees it as her home too.
"Nice! I need a shower."

You can say I'm paranoid. Our house is in the suburbs, completely walled off with electric fences on top. There are cameras all along the wall and as soon as I leave the car I start checking on their feeds on my phone.

Everything seems clear for now. But I can already tell I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight.

Katherine immediately goes through the front door and I can already hear the noises of fake gun shots coming from the living room.

"Hey, Kid!" I can hear kat saying "Watcha playin?" I'm also moving towards the door as I check the feeds. Nothing suspicious in the recordings yet.
"Call of Duty." Felix answers. He's sitting in the living room couch, playing his Playstation.
"Oh yeah? Huh, it's different from what I remember."
"They release a new one every year."
"You're buying a new one of these every year?"
"No, they're rented."

Still looking at the feeds and recordings I sit by Felix's side and reach for his shoulder, but he moves away from me.

"You ok Felix?"
"Yeah."
"Seen anything weird near the house tonight?"
"Just Kat bleeding, but I'm used to it."
"Hah! You're good kid." Katherine pats him in the back and he smiles. That stings a bit, but... It was always like that. "I'm gonna take a shower now and find myself something to eat." She rises from how she was leaning over the couch and takes her backpack to the corridor where she disappears from view.

Alright just one more camera to check. But then, after a couple of minutes in silence, I'm caught by surprise by Felix talking.

"Did she almost die again?"
"Uh... Yeah."
"Thanks for saving her."
"Yeah, no problem."

More awkward silence.

I try to raise him as my son, but even after 4 years he doesn't see me as a father. Which is fine. He can feel however he wants about me. And since Katherine got into our lives he has become a lot closer to her than he ever was to me.

"Did you have dinner?"
"Uh-huh"
"What about homework?"
"No homework today."

I just watch him play for a while.

He's pretty good. I used to be just as good as him on Counter Strike, though I used a keyboard and mouse back then. Dunno if I could handle an FPS with a controller.

"Get outta here!" Holy shit, that was a clean shot!
"Damn, son, that was good."

He doesn't answer.

"Alright I'll leave you to it. Try to go to bed at a reasonable time ok?"
"Uh-huh."

I get up from the couch. I guess today is not the day. I head to my room hoping to shower and lie down a while, where I am surprised by a wet-haired Katherine sitting on my bed, using my bathrobes, and smoking a cheap cigarette as she checks her phone.

"Hey, kons! The other shower is busted so I used yours."
"Of course you did."

I start to undress. And that might seem strange to others but we're close enough to each other as not to care about modesty.

"We'll probably have to call mama tomorrow to explain the situation." I start explaining. "And we'll probably have to be ready for retaliation."
"You think your mama might have a job for me? On the count of me... Uh... Killing my own boss."
"I don't think anyone who hears of this will ever want to hire you ever." She mops. I sigh. "But we can try, sure. It's my hide on the line, not yours."
"Come on man, we've been working together for ages. Your mama must know I'm reliable as long as she's not scum like Chester. And since she raised you I'm pretty sure she can't be scum."
"Well, she is a bitch." I extend my hand to Katherine letting her know I want my bathrobe back. She undresses and gives it to me without complaining. "But you're right. She's not 'scum'. I think you two wouldn't have moral disagreements."

I open the door to my bathroom and look back at Katherine.

"Now, would you please put some clothes on?"
